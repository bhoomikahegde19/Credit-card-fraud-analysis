Credit Card Fraud Analysis Dashboard
Problem Statement
This dashboard helps financial institutions analyze credit card transactions to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. By visualizing transaction patterns and identifying anomalies, it enables banks to quickly spot suspicious behavior and reduce financial losses. The dashboard also provides insights into the distribution of fraudulent vs. genuine transactions, helping to improve fraud detection models and risk management strategies.

Given the increasing number of fraud attempts, early detection is critical to safeguard customers and reduce operational costs for banks. This dashboard equips fraud analysts with interactive visuals to monitor transaction volumes, fraud rates, and key risk indicators in near real-time.

Steps Followed
Step 1: Load the credit card transaction dataset into Power BI Desktop, the data is in CSV format.

Step 2: Use Power Query Editor to clean and preprocess the data, removing duplicates and handling missing values.

Step 3: Enable column profiling for the entire dataset to assess data quality and identify any anomalies.

Step 4: Create calculated columns to categorize transactions by amount ranges, transaction types, and time intervals.

Step 5: Design measures to calculate total transactions, fraudulent transactions, and fraud percentages using DAX formulas.

Step 6: Build visuals such as clustered bar charts for fraud counts by transaction type, heatmaps for transaction volume by hour, and card visuals for key metrics.

Step 7: Add slicers to filter data by cardholder demographics, transaction location, and time periods for dynamic exploration.

Step 8: Incorporate a time series chart to analyze trends in fraudulent activities over days and months.

Step 9: Publish the report to Power BI Service for stakeholder access and collaboration.

Step 10: Continuously update the dashboard with new transaction data to track emerging fraud patterns.

Insights
From the dashboard, several key insights can be derived:

Fraudulent transactions constitute approximately X% of total transactions, highlighting the ongoing risk faced by the institution.

Higher fraud rates are observed in specific transaction types such as online purchases and international transactions.

Transaction volume peaks during certain hours of the day, with fraud attempts also rising during these periods, suggesting targeted fraudulent activity.

Certain geographic regions exhibit higher fraud incidences, indicating areas requiring increased monitoring.

Customers with higher transaction amounts tend to experience more fraud, underlining the need for enhanced verification for large purchases.

The dashboard also reveals the effectiveness of fraud detection measures over time, with fluctuations indicating periods of increased vigilance or vulnerability.
